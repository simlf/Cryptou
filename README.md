## Environment Configuration

Before running the application, you need to set up the environment variables:

1. Take a look at the `.env.template` file in the `documentations/` directory which contains a sample configuration. Review the file to understand the required environment variables.

2. Create a new `.env` file by copying the `.env.template` file:

```bash
   cp doc/.env.template .env
```

3. Edit the .env file with your specific configurations.
