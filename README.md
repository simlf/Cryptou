```

### Run on Docker containers

Make sure you have docker and docker-compose installed on your machine.

Make sure you have the `.env` file in the root directory of the project (check the `.env.template` file for the required environment variables).

Run the following command to start the application:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

## Environment Configuration

Before running the application, you need to set up the environment variables:

1. Take a look at the `.env.template` file in the `documentations/` directory which contains a sample configuration. Review the file to understand the required environment variables.

2. Create a new `.env` file by copying the `.env.template` file:

```bash
   cp doc/.env.template .env
```

3. Edit the .env file with your specific configurations.

## Swagger/OpenAPI Documentation

You can access Swagger-UI at : <YOUR-BASE-API-URL>/api-docs

When you add new routes to the application, it's important to document them using Swagger/OpenAPI annotations. This ensures that our API documentation stays up-to-date and is easily accessible through Swagger UI.
How to Document Routes :

1. Use @openapi Annotations: Each route should be documented with @openapi comments directly above the route handler. These comments should describe the endpoint, its parameters, request body (if applicable), and response structure.

2. Parameters and Responses: Clearly define all parameters (path, query, body, etc.) and possible response types, including success and error responses. Use the appropriate schema types.

3. Maintain Consistency: Follow the existing documentation style for consistency. Refer to already documented routes for examples.

4. Testing: After adding annotations, test the route documentation by running the application and accessing the Swagger UI to ensure that the route appears correctly and the documentation is accurate.

### Testing

To test the authentication and the middleware using Swagger, you need to go to the Swagger UI and click on the "Authorize" button on the top right corner. Then, you need to enter the JWT token in the "Value" field. The token can be obtained by logging in using the `/login` route.
