## How to write commit messages ?

- Use imperative tense (avoid past tense).
- The title of the commit must be a summuary of the content and not be too long (less than 50 characters).
- Prefer putting detailed informations inside the commit's description.
- The title of the commit must start by a GitMoji describing visually the nature of the commit, below is an example.
